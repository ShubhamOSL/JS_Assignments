## Introduction
Welcome to the Resume Builder project! This web-based application empowers users to create, edit, and preview their resumes effortlessly. Whether you're a job seeker, student, or professional, this tool simplifies the process of crafting a well-organized and visually appealing resume.

## Project Overview
The Resume Builder project consists of a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files designed to provide a user-friendly interface for building and customizing resumes. Here's an overview of the key components:

### 1. `index.html`
This is the main page where users input their resume data. It offers sections for personal information, education, work experience, and skills. Users can generate, save, and load resumes from this page.

### 2. `resume.html`
The resume preview page, where users can view their generated resumes in a well-formatted and organized layout. It provides a professional and polished presentation of your resume.

### 3. `script.js`
The JavaScript file that powers the Resume Builder's functionality. It handles user interactions, data validation, resume generation, saving, and loading.

### 4. `styles.css` and `resume.css`
The CSS files that define the styling for the main pages and the resume preview page, respectively.
